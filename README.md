# PID-Controller-Udacity

PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. These three components are combined in such a way that it produces a control signal.

## CTE 
A cross track error is a distance of the vehicle from trajectory. In theory itâ€™s best suited to control the car by steering in proportion to Cross Track Error(CTE)
